# day1 -> tried to do it myself but i cudnt understand much tho i made a simple hello mod
        insmod <- this is used to load the module 
            calls the 'init_module' in the module for the insertion to the kernel space
            transfers the cntrl to the kernel 
            kernel executes the 'sys_init_module'
            verifies the permissions
            'load_module' is called
        rmmod  <- this is used to remove or unload the moduel
        dmesg  <- we use this to check on the kernel log to see if the mod works
# day2 -> taking a yt video to learn about the ldd better.
        lsmod  <- to check if the mod is loaded
        lsmod | grep <mod_name> <- use this to just see if the mod is loaded and exists.
