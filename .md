# Day1 
    -> tried to do it myself but i cudnt understand much tho i made a simple hello mod
        insmod <- this is used to load the module 
            calls the 'init_module' in the module for the insertion to the kernel space
            transfers the cntrl to the kernel 
            kernel executes the 'sys_init_module'
            verifies the permissions
            'load_module' is called
        rmmod  <- this is used to remove or unload the moduel
            call the 'delete_module()' for the removal of the module
            kernel execs the sys_delete_module()
            then execs the func in the exit_module()
            then kernel calls free_module()
         dmesg  <- we use this to check on the kernel log to see if the mod works
# Day2 
    -> taking a yt video to learn about the ldd better.
        lsmod  <- to check if the mod is loaded
        lsmod | grep <mod_name> <- use this to just see if the mod is loaded and exists.
        modinfo <mod_name> <- gives back the info regarding the module
    -> currently learnt how to make a proc device and how to remove
       also how to opearte on it.
    -> so i am done for today && i am done making the proc file which is accessable and 
       saves value, i had implemented both read and write for the driver
